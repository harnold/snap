               snap - a simple backup tool based on rsync

Overview

    With snap you can create incremental snapshots of directory trees.
    Every snapshot taken by snap is a full copy of the source directory,
    which can be explored and restored using normal file commands.  To
    save time and disk space, snap uses hard links to store files that
    have not changed between subsequent backups.

Installation

    Snap needs somewhat recent versions of Bash and rsync installed.
    It has only been tested on Linux, but it should run on most Unix-
    like operating systems.

    You can run snap from any directory.  To make the program available
    to all users, either use the provided Makefile or install the files
    manually, for example by executing the following commands as root or
    using sudo:

        install snap /usr/local/bin
        install -m 644 snap.1 /usr/local/man/man1
