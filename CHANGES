* Version 0.3

  - A new option -f/--full-copy has been added.  When this option is used,
    rsync-backup does not scan the archive directory for previous backups.

* Version 0.2

  - The name format of the backup directories has changed to <date>--<time>,
    (YYYY-MM-DD--HH-MM-SS, to be precise), without appended UID.
