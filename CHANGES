Changes in rsync-backup
=======================


Version 0.3.2 (2011-10-23)
--------------------------

Changes:

 * When a configuration file cannot be read, rsync-backup no longer fails but
   works as if the file would not exist.

 * In interactive mode, you must press "Enter" to enter your answer to the
   confirmation request.

Bugs fixed:

 * The "-f/--full-copy" option did not work.

 * rsync-backup could be confused by setting certain environment variables.


0.3.1 (2011-04-10)
------------------

New features:

 * New option "-f/--full-copy" for doing non-incremental backups.  This option
   prevents rsync-backup from scanning the archive directory for previous
   backups.


0.2 (2011-04-05)
----------------

Changes:

 * The name format of the backup directories has changed to <date>--<time>,
   (YYYY-MM-DD--HH-MM-SS, to be precise), without appended UID.
