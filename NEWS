Changes in Snap (aka rsync-backup)


0.3.4 (2013-09-08)

    No user-visible changes.

0.3.3 (2011-12-11)

    Changes:

      * The program has been renamed "Snap".

0.3.2 (2011-10-23)

    Changes:

      * When a configuration file cannot be read, the program no longer
        fails but works as if the file would not exist.

      * In interactive mode, you must press "Enter" to enter your answer
        to the confirmation request.

    Bugs fixed:

      * The "-f/--full-copy" option did not work.

      * rsync-backup could be confused by setting certain environment
        variables.

0.3.1 (2011-04-10)

    New features:

      * New option "-f/--full-copy" for doing non-incremental backups.
        This option prevents rsync-backup from scanning the archive
        directory for previous backups.

0.2 (2011-04-05)

    Changes:

      * The name format of the backup directories has changed to
        <date>--<time>, (YYYY-MM-DD--HH-MM-SS, to be precise), without
        appended UID.
